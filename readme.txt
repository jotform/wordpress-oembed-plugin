== Description ==

Adding a web form to your blog post is now very easy using Jotform's oEmbed plugin. When you install it, Wordpress will be aware of Jotform form URLs, and easily embed them to your blog posts.

This plugin is great if you want to add a survey to your blog post. You can survey your readers and then write about the results in a future blog post.

Another common use of forms in blogs is to do giveaways. For example, you can tell your users youâ€™ll be giving away something valuable to the first 10 people who fill out the form.

Jotform is an easy to use drag and drop form builder trusted by over 20 million users. Its intuitive user interface makes building a form a breeze. Jotform is FREE with up to 100 submissions per month. If your forms get submitted more than 100 times, other Jotform plans start from $34/month.
